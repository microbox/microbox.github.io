The images are build from official binaries or source code using buildroot. Then remove the unnecessary files e.g. document, man, libs and replacing the whole OS with busybox.\r\n\r\n|image|size|versions|\r\n|-----|--------|-----|\r\n|microbox/**redis**|7MB | `latest` `2.8.17` `2.8.16` `2.8.15` `2.8.14` `2.8.13` `2.8.12` `2.8.11` `2.8.10` `2.6.17`| \r\n|microbox/**rethinkdb**|50MB |`latest` `1.15.1` `1.15.0`| \r\n|microbox/**etcd**|17MB |`latest` `0.4.6`| \r\n\r\n\r\n### Don't use docker like a Virtual Machine\r\nReally, you shouldn't put the whole OS into the docker image at most of the time. Docker is using the Linux [namespace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups) to isolate the process. It's more like a process management tool. Most of the files are not required to run your application. if you want to see what's happen in the container, please use [nsenter](https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter).\r\n\r\n### I want more **Microbox** images\r\nPlease vote [here](https://github.com/microbox/microbox.github.io/issues), we will add more images according to your suggestions.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n[Docker](http://docker.io)\r\n[Busybox](http://busybox.net)\r\n[Buildroot](http://buildroot.uclibc.org)\r\n","google":"UA-54705570-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
